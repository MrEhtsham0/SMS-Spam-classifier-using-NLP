Creating an SMS spam classifier involves building a model that can distinguish between spam and ham (non-spam) messages. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK), and machine learning algorithms. Here’s a detailed description of how such a project can be structured:

## Project Overview
Objective
The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model that can automatically identify whether an SMS message is spam or not.

Tools and Libraries
NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For text preprocessing and handling various NLP tasks.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning models.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

## Steps Involved
1. ### Data Collection
    Dataset: Obtain a labeled dataset containing SMS messages classified as spam or ham. An example dataset is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset.

2. ### Data Preprocessing
Loading the Data: Use Pandas to load the dataset.

3. ### Text Cleaning:
    Remove punctuation, numbers, and special characters.
    Convert all text to lowercase.
    Remove stop words (common words that don’t contribute much to the meaning, e.g., 'is', 'and', 'the').

4. Tokenization: Split messages into individual words or tokens.
5. Lemmatization/Stemming: Reduce words to their base or root form.
